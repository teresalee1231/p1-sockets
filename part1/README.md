## Instructions on how to compile and run your code:
Make sure server is running first.
Run the client.py on another attu server (not attu3 or 2)

### To connect to attu2/3, edit the global variable SERVER_HOST (at the top of client.py) and re-run the program:
SERVER_HOST = 'attu2.cs.washington.edu'     # for attu2 (aka YOUR server) \
SERVER_HOST = 'attu3.cs.washington.edu'     # for attu3 (aka OUR server)

### To run the client, enter in the terminal:
python3 client.py

### To force shut down client:
