### Instructions on how to compile and run your code:

Run the Server on attu3.

Enter to command line:

python3 server.py

To shut down server:

Ctrl+C

If there are any issues running the server because another program is using that port, just change the PORT (global variable in server.py) to something such as 12237 or 12238, will need to adjust in client too, see client README.md for more information.
